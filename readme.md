# Relana

Relana is a **Rel**iability **ana**lyzer.

It is quite old but I wanted to publish now.
Unfortunately, currently I dont have time to add documentation
which is obviously necessary to take advantage of this software.
To make things worse: The software is so old that I had to reverse engineer.
Some pieces of information may be found in ./src/site/xdoc/overview.xml.vm. 
Maybe the build of this project is to use another default lifecycle.
